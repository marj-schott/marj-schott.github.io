        <dt>Baseline Model</dt>
        <dd>Typically used for comparison purposes, baseline models represent a theoretical benchmark against which the proposed design can be studied. It can be used to calculate percent energy savings from “typical” design. As zero energy defines an absolute energy goal, baseline models are not necessary unless energy savings is needed for some other reason. It can also serve as a starting point for analysis, as the code-compliant building is the worst energy performing building that can be legally constructed. </dd>

        <dd>An energy management system, usually with aitional capabilities, relating to the overall operation of the building in which it is installed, such as equipment monitoring, protection of equipment against power failure, and building security.(source: ASHRAE Terminology, https://xp20.ashrae.org/terminology)</dd>

        <dt>Building envelope</dt>
        <dd>(1) Outer elements of a building, including walls, windows, doors, roofs, and floors, including those in contact with earth. (2) The exterior plus the semi-exterior portions of a building. For the purposes of determining building envelope requirements, the classifications are defined as follows. Building envelope, exterior: the elements of a building that separate conditioned spaces from the exterior. Building envelope, semi-exterior: the elements of a building that separate conditioned space from unconditioned space or that enclose semiheated spaces through which thermal energy may be transferred to or from the exterior, to or from unconditioned spaces, or to or from conditioned spaces.(source: ASHRAE Terminology, https://xp20.ashrae.org/terminology)</dd>


        <dt>Building Performance Simulation</dt>
        <dd>Encompasses the numerous forms of computational simulation that may be conducted during the design process. "Energy modeling" is often referenced among designers and remains an accurate description of the simulation process used to study the energy performance of a building.In aition to energy modeling, high-performance buildings typically require other analyses to optimize the design. Some of the more common simulations cover lighting, daylighting, and natural ventilation strategies.</dd>

        <dt>Calibrated Model</dt>
        <dd>The calibrated model is created to reflect the most accurate set of conditions following construction and during the occupancy of the building. This should reflect as-installed equipment, as-tested performance information (such as enclosure leakage), and include actual weather and occupancy information. The calibrated model is ultimately used in the measurement and verification process to tune the building and ensure that it is operating properly. When deviations from actual performance exist, they can be compared against the calibrated model looking for issues to correct.</dd>

        <dt>Construction manager at risk (CMR) </dt>
        <dd>Construction manager at risk or integrated project delivery approach is where the owner, A/E team, and contractor are brought together as one project team as early as possible in the design process. With CMR, the owner negotiates a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) or maximum allowable construction cost with the CMR. This option offers a means for the contractor to become part of the integrated project delivery team as early as possible in the process, preferably no later than concept design, and as a result is most likely to deliver a building that achieves and sustains zero energy performance. The general contractor or construction manager is able to advocate for feasible solutions and troubleshoot constructability questions, while cost control can be maintained through competitive bids of the subcontracts.</dd>

        <dt>Design-bid-build</dt>
        <dd>Design-bid-build delivery method involves three sequential project phases: the design phase, which requires the services of a designer who will be the “designer of record” for the project; the bid phase, when a contractor is selected; and a build or construction phase, when the project is built by the selected contractor. Because owners are working with separate entities, there may be less opportunity for innovation and optimization through design enhancements integrated with construction technologies and methods. In aition, there may be a constraint to require selection of the lowest bid on this type of procurement, which can create challenges with achieving zero energy. Even if the lowest bier understands the requirements for zero energy, it may be all but impossible to ensure that all subcontractors and suppliers do so when lowest price is the prime selection criterion. The Discovery Elementary project was a Design-Bid-Build project.</dd>

        <dt>Design/build</dt>
        <dd>Design/build offers increased opportunities for integration of design with cost-effective construction methods, because the design and construction are carried out by the same entity. Here the challenge is to craft the RFP so that the critical project parameters are maintained throughout the course of design and construction. This typically requires hiring a design team to help develop the RFP, which as overhead and complexity to the process. One of the challenges with the design/build RFP process is striking an appropriate balance between defining the critical parameters in sufficient detail and leaving room for possible innovations by the design/build team.</dd>

        <dt>Design Model</dt>
        <dd>Design models are intended to weigh trade-offs and evaluate strategies and features. These strategies are tested to determine the impact and progress toward meeting the goal. Ideally, this model is started at conceptual design and informs the form of the building. This model may not represent the final design, as it may need to satisfy rules associated with showing code compliance.</dd>

        <dt>Ground-source heat pump or GSHP</dt>
        <dd>A geothermal heat pump or ground source heat pump (GSHP) is a central heating and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground. It uses the earth all the time, without any intermittency, as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and may be combined with solar heating to form a geosolar system with even greater efficiency. They are also known by other names, including geoexchange, earth-coupled, earth energy systems. The engineering and scientific communities prefer the terms "geoexchange" or "ground source heat pumps" to avoid confusion with traditional geothermal power, which uses a high temperature heat source to generate electricity. Ground source heat pumps harvest heat absorbed at the Earth's surface from solar energy. The temperature in the ground below 6 metres (20 ft) is roughly equal to the mean annual air temperature at that latitude at the surface. Depending on latitude, the temperature beneath the upper 6 metres (20 ft) of Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16 °C (50 and 60 °F), if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a heat pump to force the transfer of heat from the ground. Heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space, against the natural direction of flow, or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one. The core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle that moves heat. Air-source heat pumps are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters, even when extracting heat from cold winter air, although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5 °C (41 °F). A ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground. This is much more energy-efficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year. Seasonal variations drop off with depth and disappear below 7 metres (23 ft) to 12 metres (39 ft) due to thermal inertia. Like a cave, the shallow ground temperature is warmer than the air above during the winter and cooler than the air in the summer. A ground source heat pump extracts ground heat in the winter (for heating) and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer (for cooling). Some systems are designed to operate in one mode only, heating or cooling, depending on climate. Geothermal pump systems reach fairly high coefficient of performance (CoP), 3 to 6, on the coldest of winter nights, compared to 1.75–2.5 for air-source heat pumps on cool days. Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) are among the most energy-efficient technologies for providing HVAC and water heating. Setup costs are higher than for conventional systems, but the difference is usually returned in energy savings in 3 to 10 years, and even shorter lengths of time with federal, state and utility tax credits and incentives. Geothermal heat pump systems are reasonably warranted by manufacturers, and their working life is estimated at 25 years for inside components and 50+ years for the ground loop. As of 2004, there are over one million units installed worldwide providing 12 GW of thermal capacity, with an annual growth rate of 10%.(source: https://openei.org/wiki/Definition:Ground_Source_Heat_Pumps)</dd>

        <dt>Performance-based procurement</dt>
        <dd>Performance-based procurement is an alternative to design/build. In this approach, the criteria for the project are performance or goal-based. Rather than actual solutions, biers are provided with objectives for a project and the success criteria if the objective has been met. The price for the project is fixed and a contractor team (that includes full design services) is selected based on who can achieve the most objectives for the fixed price. Note that the owner must prioritize the objectives and the objectives must be selected in order without skipping any. It does require that the owner have a clear prioritization of project requirements in the RFP to ensure that the specifications and goals were not compromised. The result is that the owner competitively achieves the most prioritized scope for the funding available. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, used this technique to create a large-scale office building that saved 50% of the energy at no aitional cost, including the photovoltaics, which brought the building to zero energy.</dd>

Predictive models need to meet the zero energy design goals, including those for renewable generation. These models also include passive strategies that are used to eliminate or reduce mechanical cooling requirements, or when the design team plans to use plug load reduction by selecting efficient equipment. The predictive model should match the final set of plans used for construction.</dd>
